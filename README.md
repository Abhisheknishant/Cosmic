# Cosmic

Cosmic is a software simulated, from-scratch, 8-bit microcomputer designed to resemble retro computers. Cosmic consists of many parts including a simulated CPU, underlaying system, inputs and outputs, and graphics. In addition to the simulated machine, we plan to write software that targets the device. The goal of Cosmic is to develop a system that is equivalent to an Apple II, TRS-80, and similar machines of the era.
