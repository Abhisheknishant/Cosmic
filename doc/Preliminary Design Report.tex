\section{Design Constraints \textbackslash Problem Definition}


\section{Timeline \textbackslash Schedule}

\subsection{Designing and Developing the Cosmic Systems}

\subsection{Writing Software that Targets or Supports Cosmic}

\section{Budget}

Our current budget is \$0. Since our entire project is in software, nothing needs to be bought. Later on we plan on adding interfacing with the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. However, we already have all of the hardware we would need for that
\section{Social, Ethical, and Environmental Impacts} 

\subsection{Social Impacts}

Our project doesn't have any direct social impacts. It's a project that many people will find interesting and could be useful in an education environment since it shows everything that is going on.

\subsection{Ethical Impacts}

The biggest ethical factor of our project is about the code itself. We decided to keep the project 100\% open source. We think this is important for a project like this. All of the libraries, included and not are also all open source.
